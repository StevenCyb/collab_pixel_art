# Collab Pixel Art
Collab Pixel Art is a project I have created to play around with SocketIO.
The basic idea is that multiple users can collaborate and draw on a pixel graphic together. 
This pixel art can be saved as PNG or exported and imported as a raw file for later editing.
You can run the server with the following command (PORT is optional).

```
node server.js PORT=8080
```

You should now see the message:

```
Listening on port 8080
```

Then just open the browser and navigate to `localhost:8080`.
